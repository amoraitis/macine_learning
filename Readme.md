# Airbnb Price Prediction

Due to the fact that most of the Airbnb hosts are daily users with no expertise in travel industry and real estate, one of the challenges that faces is the one of pricing. 
The scope of this project is to create a deep learning alogrithm to predict the price of an Airbnb listing .


## Description

Many Airbnb’s hosts underestimate their properties and don’t believe that they can make more money. Airbnb is platform where anyone can post a property for short-term rent but also can book a property.
This project’s aim is to build a service that will help many Airbnb’s hosts in the Greek market, because they can get an price estimation or useful tips for their listings based on specialized deep learning techniques. In this context, the term “host/hosts” refers to the users that rent properties in Airbnb, while the property that are rented, are called as “listings”.
