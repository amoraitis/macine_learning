## Airbnb Price Prediction

### Project setup

If you want to omit downloading the photos which is a time-consuming procedure, set the `constants.SHOULD_DOWNLOAD_IMAGES` to `False` and you will get only the tabular data from *insideairbnb*.

- Set the directory in which the data will be stored in `constants.DATA_PATH`.
- Run the `acquisition.py` main method to download the data.
- `simple-regr.ipynb` has sample code in the first data set to read the dataset.
